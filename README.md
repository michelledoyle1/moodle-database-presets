Moodle Database Presets

## Fadlet 1.0
Description:
* Masonry layout
* Choose colours for a card
* Responsive - cards will breakdown to 4,to 2, to 1 based on screen size
* Rating and comments available ON card in List view. For added fun, add ratings of hearts, stars and thumbs up and allow students to rate one another.
* Audio player auto resize
* Name and date truncates

Suggested date formate is DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY for better screen size. Works with Database higher than 4.1, which uses 'Action menu' shortcode.

Inspired by Padlet, Pinterest and Milanote, etc.

Original masonry code and truncate code by [Stephan Robotta](https://github.com/srobotta). My work on this would not be possible without his kindness and generosity on the Moodle user forum.
