## Credits

* Original masonry code and truncate code by [Stephan Robotta](https://github.com/srobotta). His kindness by sharing this code has really fed my creativity.
* [Florian Dagner](https://github.com/fdagner)'s sticky notes and other Database presets also really inspired me.
* [Moodle Database forum](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=3505) endless inspiration and support from the community.
* ChatGPT - in the interest of transparency I credit this tool for much of the javascript work and cleanup in my code.

## Warning

I'm not a good coder, I just have problems I gotta solve! These might break.
These presets will need syncing with your layout and only work if you have ##actionsmenu## which is available in more recent Moodle Database upgrades.
